Grant Of License

      use SQLite Expert Professional on one computer.

      Home users may use their single computer usage license on all 
      computers which are in property of the license owner.

      Business users require one license per computer SQLite Expert

  b.  A site license. The user purchases a usage license for use, by the 
      purchaser or the purchaser's employees on an unlimited number of 
      computers located on the same site. For an organization with locations 
      in more than one city, each location is considered to be a separate 
      site and would require a separate license.
